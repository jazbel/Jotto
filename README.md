Jotto
What is it?
-----------
Jotto is similar to a word-based version of “Mastermind.”  The computer chooses a “target” word for the user to guess. The word has five letters; letters may be repeated. The user attempts to guess the target word by guessing five letter words. For each guess, the computer will tell the number of exact matches and the number of partial matches. An exact match occurs when the same letter appears in the same position in both the guessed word and the target word. A partial match occurs when the same letter appears in both the target and the guess but in different positions. Any given letter is only reported once; it can't be both an exact match with one letter and a partial match with another. Exact matches have priority over partial matches.
